                Not all Indian food uses ‘Curry’ and not all curry is spicy. There is so much more to Indian food than
                just Butter Chicken. Each region of India has its own unique and exciting combination of flavours and
                ingredients – each city, town, and even family prepares dishes differently. While this is part of the
                magic of Indian cuisine, it doesn’t tell the whole story of Indian Food.
            </p>

                There can be a tendency in North America to simplify exotic cuisines and assume that food from other
                countries is homogenous. For Indian Food this couldn’t be further from the truth. At Tahn Door we’re
                working to educate our customers to make informed decisions about what they are eating. At the same
                time, learning about the rich cultural traditions that Indian food so deeply connects to. Another common
                misconception is that all Indian food is heavy, rich and unhealthy. Obviously this is untrue, as with
                any type of cuisine there is a wide variety of Indian food. Countless Indian dishes offer a light,
                healthy, and fresh experience, especially when considering ingredients that might otherwise be
                considered boring.

                puffed puri at any Indian grocery store or prepare at home with this recipe. Some of the earliest
                mentions of what we know of today as the samosa can be found in Persian writings dating back to the 9th
                century. Scripts from throughout the Arab world between the 10th and 13th century also make mention of
                it, though the recipe is always similar: oil, butter, salt, dough, and warm water. A simple dish known
                by many names in many regions.
