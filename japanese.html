                Japanese cuisine has been influenced by the food customs of other nations, but has adopted and refined
                them to create its own unique cooking style and eating habits.
                The first foreign influence on Japan was China around 300 B.C. , when the Japanese learned to cultivate
                rice. The use of chopsticks and the consumption of soy sauce and soybean curd (tofu) also came from
                China.

            <p>
                Rice and noodles are the two primary staples of the Japanese diet. Rice, either boiled or steamed, is
                served at every meal. Noodles come in many varieties. Among the most popular are soba, thin brown
                noodles made from buckwheat flour; udon, thick white noodles made from wheat flour; and ramen, thin,
                curly noodles, also made from wheat flour . Soy sauce and other soybean products are also staples in
                Japan. These include miso (fermented soybean paste) and tofu (a soybean curd that resembles custard).
                Other common ingredients in Japanese food include bamboo shoots, daikon (a giant white radish), ginger,
                seaweed, and sesame seed products. Japanese pickles called tsukemono are served at every meal. Seafood
                is also plentiful in this island nation. Green tea is the national beverage of Japan, although black tea
                is also available. Sake (SAH-kee, wine made from rice, usually served warm) and beer are also very
                popular

            <h4>Soba</h4>
            <p>
                Soba (そば) noodles are noodles made of buckwheat flour, roughly as thick as spaghetti, and prepared in
                various hot and cold dishes. Soba dishes are very popular and easily available nationwide. As 100%
                buckwheat soba noodles tend to be brittle, many restaurants add some wheat flour when preparing their
                noodles. Depending on the shop, the percentage of buckwheat flour in soba noodles typically ranges
                between 40% and 100%.
                Note also that there are a few noodle dishes named soba (e.g. yakisoba, chukasoba or Okinawa Soba) that
                are not made with buckwheat noodles. More often than not, however, "soba" refers to buckwheat noodles.

            <h4>Sushi</h4>
            <p>
                Sushi is perhaps the most famous Japanese food in the world. Sushi is defined as any dish that is made
                with vinegared sushi rice. Although you can make sushi without using any fish or raw fish, many kinds of
                seafood are used in sushi dishes.
                Since Japan is surrounded by ocean, seafood has always been widely consumed as well as rice. Originally,
                sushi was fermented fish with rice preserved in salt, and this was a staple dish in Japan for a thousand
                years until the Edo Period (1603 to 1868) when contemporary sushi was developed. The word "sushi" means
                "it's sour," which reflects back to sushi's origins of being preserved in salt. Contemporary sushi was
                developed to be a type of fast food and remains so to this day.
